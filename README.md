## Description
When you close the Combat Tracker:
- See the total of experience for all hostile combatants
- See the per-player-token experience
- Adjust experience for friendlies
- Adjust experience for defeated foes
- Optionally add the experience to players' character sheets

If CUB's one-checkbox "Award experience" isn't granular enough for you, or you want to adjust experience for NPC allies, then Easy XP is what you need!
